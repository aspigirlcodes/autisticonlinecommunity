## Rules

This website is not curating or taking responsibility for any of the linked content.
We do our best to keep the content up to date and you can help with that (see above for ways to contribute). It would be impossible to thoroughly read every blog or every social media profile linked here. There are however some rules for (linked) content that we try to adhere to in order to keep it useful for as many autistic people as possible.
* Content linked to from a certain language welcome page should be (mainly) in that language.
* Although we cannot monitor all linked content in detail, we do not want to link harmful content. Reporting of links to harmful content is welcome through any of the channels mentioned above.
* Content linked here should be made by autistic people. Certainly there is also valuable content about autism that is not created by autistic people, however in this place we do want to focus on autistic voices.
* All text on this website should be written in a friendly tone and should help people find their way in the online autistic community.
