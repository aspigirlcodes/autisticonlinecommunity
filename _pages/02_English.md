Hi,

With this website we want to welcome you to the online autistic community.
Sure we have to admit that there is really no such thing as THE online autistic community, but there are a lot of autistic people out there discussing relevant topics online using different channels.
So if you want to put it correctly, there are lots of online autistic communities that may or may not overlap with each other.
If you are new here this can be quite overwhelming at first.
That is where this website wants to help.
No matter whether you got your diagnosis a couple of days ago or for a long time already,
whether you want to passively follow along, or actively contribute,
we are glad you are here and we hope you will quickly feel at home in
our online community/communities.

We've created a short introduction to each channel containing lots of useful links to get you started.
We hope you enjoy reading along and contributing wherever you want to.

This website is being created and kept up-to-date by the community itself.
If you find something is wrong or missing, [feel free to let us know](/contribute).

### Twitter
A lot of autistic people are active on twitter. They use hashtags such as [\#actuallyAutistic](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ActuallyAutistic) and (for women) [\#sheCantBeAutistic](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sheCantBeAutistic).
Occasionally autistic twitter likes to make fun of Neurotypical folks using hashtags such as [\#neurotypicalisms](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23neurotypicalisms) or bots
such as [@AutismStyle](https://twitter.com/AutismStyle).

Besides [the general tips at the bottom](#tips), some good practices specifically for twitter are:
* Check peoples biographies for preferred pronouns before talking about them in third person.
* Add alternative text to any images you post
(google twitter image alternative text for instructions on how to turn this feature on)

### Some tips {#tips}
**Stay healthy:**
The online community never sleeps, and that can be quite overwhelming.
Keep in mind that things posted today probably are still relevant tomorrow, so you don't have to feel pressured to answer straight away.
Take breaks whenever you need them, we want you to stay happy and healthy!

**Stay positive:**
We won't deny it, there is lots of negativity online too,
coming both from inside and outside the autistic community.
You don't have to be best friends with everyone of course,
but bigotry and harassment are not ok.

You can use reporting, blocking, and muting functions existing in different social media
to help you not wasting too much energy on attacks or negative people.
Those features are often not perfect, but they do help.

**Vocabulary:**
One of the reasons you might experience negative reactions online is for (accidentally) using the wrong vocabulary. You will quickly notice that a lot of words you might have heard during your diagnosis or read about in research papers are considered offensive by a lot of autistic people online.

I do wish people were a bit more accepting of people (especially new people) using different words than they prefer to, but a lot of us are very sensitive about this. If you get called out on vocabulary issues, try to stay calm and to not take it personally. It might not look so at first sight but everyone uses wordings that offend other people from time to time. This is not about them being better than you in any way. They are just more trained in this topic. Just apologize and change your wording, that is enough. You do not need to stick around in any heated discussions if you don't want to. Try to remember next time to write it differently, but if you forget again, that's ok too.

Here is a list of typical things that upset people:
* Consistent use of **people-first language** as opposed to identity-first language which is preferred by the autistic community. People-first language(eg. person with autism, I have autism) is a widely spread linguistic prescription in English to talk about people with disabilities. It is however not widely accepted in the autistic community because most autistic people consider autism as being part of their personality. The alternative is identity-first language (eg. autistic person, I am autistic). There are many blogposts and articles written about this if you want to read more. Otherwise just keep in mind that while it is ok to use person first language when referring to yourself if you prefer it this way, when talking about autistic people in general it is good practice to use identity-first language.

* **Functioning labels** and related vocabulary: Some of us might have heard during their diagnosis that they are considered high-functioning, or that they have Aspergers syndrome, or that they are on the higher end of the autism spectrum. All of these labels somehow imply that the person getting them is not so bad of, that they are _less autistic_ or _more normal_ than someone getting the label low-functioning autism, core autism or Kanner autism. Although it might feel like a relief at first, those functioning labels are in many ways harmful to all autistic people. To give just one example, they might be used to tell people labeled high functioning that they don't get any accommodations, even if they are clearly not functioning well in that specific situation; Or to not take people called low functioning seriously, or take away their freedom to decide things on their own. You can read many more examples in blogposts on this topic. In general though these labels just have no reason to exist as there is no clear divide between high and low functioning, the world definitely is more complex than that. Therefore it is wise to stay away from the use of labels in a way of separating the autistic community into smaller groups based on some unimportant condition (such as the ability to speak at all or by a certain age).

* **Ableist language** in general: Ableism is (according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ableism)) discrimination and social prejudice against people with disabilities. Ableist language consists of often very commonly used negative references to disabilities in our everyday language. An example affecting autistic people directly is the use of the word autistic for politicians who are not taking into account the needs and will of the people they represent. But there are much more subtle varieties as well. You can find lists of ableist expressions when googling "ableist language".

* Autism as a **disability**, **disorder** or **disease**: All of these terminologies are used in relation to autism at least somewhere in official (legal or medical) paperwork. Some of those are certainly incorrect (Autism is not a disease), while others are debatable. A lot of autistic people don't consider their autism to be any of the above, and they might be offended if you use those words in relation to autism.

_Note to the more experienced members of our online community: Please try to be nice to new people and people not having English as their first language. Even when they are using words you consider ableist and/or offensive. Of course, you can point that out to them, and direct them to resources for explanation. But please do make sure they still feel welcome and get their questions answered._
